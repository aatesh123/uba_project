We could not exist as we do if there were no trees. 
In today’s scenario greenery is required to balance the environment. 
In order to increase greenery and for a healthy environment UBA Team
 of Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur had organized 
 a Tree Plantation program at Pahariya village on 3rd September 2017 
 under the aegis of UNNAT BHARAT ABHIYAAN – an initiative of Ministry
  of Human Resource and Development(MHRD) with aim to accelerate development
   and growth in villages through participatory and appropriate technologies.
    The camp was organized by UBA team headed by faculty coordinator 
    Dr. Rajiv Kumar Dhore and Dr. Madhu Agarwal and student coordinator
     Laxmi Shankar with a team of 42 enthusiastic student volunteers. 
     The camp started at 9.30am and 200 plants were carried to the village
      from MNIT by bus. Plants include Neem, Kaner, Tulsi, Jamun (plum),
       sisham, paras Peepal, Ashok tree etc. The plantation was done by whole UBA 
       team with the help of villagers and after plantation water was fed to plants
        with the help of a water tank.  <p>

            <p>
                There was an interactive session of MNIT students and villagers in which past experiences were shared by village people and they described their basic problems related with lifestyle and other things and suitable possible suggestions were given to them. After lunch, a village survey was done by the team to collect the 100% data and recognize the problems related to various issues. Overall the trip was nice, village people were very excited about the activity. They had actively taken part in the activity and finally the trip ended at 4.00pm.
